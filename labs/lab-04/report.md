(3) It's important to choose a license because licenses developers can secure their copyright protection and also gain the visibility they deserve. Software takes a lot of effort and time to develop, so it's definite that the work must be protected. With proper licensing, multiple developers can contribute to the project development without worrying about infringement or crossing set boundaries.  

(4) Using a project that doesn't have an explicit license can lead to many issues and possibly be illegal. A project without an explicit license cannot be used or modified because it is not secure or automatically in the public domain. It is just best to avoid the risk by making sure to work on projects with explicit licenses.  

(5) In the Failure to follow the Open System Model section of Why the Web beat Gopher, I agree with the stated claim that the Web beat Gopher because their team did better in the two parts of open systems model: open communications standards and open soruce software. Gopher did not follow the "worse is better" design approach-- they failed to bring in developers by forking and not being able to have a strong developer base. They also did not effectively distribute their development efforts, which prevented them from receiving valuable constructive criticism from the development community.  

(6) Linux utilizes the GPL v2 license, which is known for allowing the share and distribution of software. Linux is constantly modified to better fit the needs of users that need its certain features, and this level of modification requires a great deal of flexibility. With this license, Linux is a successful project that can efficiently be distributed everywhere and gather many developers under this project.

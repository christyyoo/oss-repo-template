1.2: Reading Assignment Reflections
-----------------------------------
### Open Source Definition
  There's a lot more to open source than just publicly accessible code, like the article mentioned. This level of collaboration requires respect for each other and licenses to dictate what can or cannot be done. All the criteria listed in this article are what allow open source to actually work and flow smoothly.
  
### Smart Questions - How to ask the question The Smart Way
  I thought that this article was very insightful and useful not only in the context of technical projects, but also in general. In any circumstance, questions have to be carefully written in order to receive the most helpful feedback or resources. Even if we may not have the time or motivation to fully research about something we are curious about, it's proper ettiquette to do some simple studying and expressing the fact that you have made an effort to answer your own questions.
  
### How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way
  1. Demonstrate examples: I find that I learn best and understand more complex concepts from examples.
  2. Try to understand the perspective of the person asking the question: There are multiple ways to approach questions. My approach for solving something may be completely different from the other person's thought process. I think it would be the most helpful by trying to answer in terms of how the other person thinks.

### Free Culture
  At first glance, I was really impressed with Jesse. As someone who had no experience in programming, he was able to use existing resources and tools to eventually create a search engine that became very useful. This is not really something I can just create in a few hours, even with available resources because project like this requires lots of commitment and research. However, as I continued to read through the chapter, I realized that skills and motivation aren't the only factors that contribute to a successful project. One thing Jesse forgot about was the consequences that can follow without proper education on copyright, licenses, and rights. It is scary that he went from playing around with technology to violating copyright laws and getting sued. Through Jesse's mistakes, I realized the significance of proper licensing and copyrighting.

1.6: Reflection

### Open Source Project: Magenta<br/>
While reading through a list of popular open source projects, Magenta caught my eye. It is a Python open source library that stems from TensorFlow and allows the manipulation of source data like images and audio. Magenta uses machine learning to teach machine learning models with existing data, creating new content and creative variations of art. As someone who is interested in machine learning and art, I felt like this open source project would be interesting to research and learn more about!
